# It Takes a Village Rescue
## Foster Database

This website was start as part of Project 2 of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course.  The idea was mentioned of working with an animal rescue, and because I had personal experience and a family connection to one I decided to pursue that.  I had the idea to create a database to help coordinate volunteer foster families and the dogs they take care of.  Currently this is all done through Facebook messaging and groups, but I thought a simple website where all the dogs and the families that care for them could leave notes, update medical information, and volunteer to foster new dogs in the system.

After quickly building a shell of the website to demonstrate where we would be working towards, the clients at the rescue decided they didn't want to go this route and instead had me start working on their main website to improve current functionality.  Without continued feedback on where to bring this database, which information is most critical to have available, how they would like access and editing to function, etc. I have to admit I stalled completely.  I eneded working very little on true functionality and had to split my time while ensuring this met MVP for the Project.  I did utilize a few new pieces of technology I did not have experience with, but missed the opporunity to experiment with others.
